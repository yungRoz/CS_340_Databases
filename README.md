# JustUs

Inspired by an episode of Black Mirror titled "Nosedive", JustUs utilizes a database to store rating information about individuals and their friends.

The idea is that it would be used in a fictitious application that gives users the ability to rate others nearby based on interactions and to see each others overall ratings as well as peer group ratings.
